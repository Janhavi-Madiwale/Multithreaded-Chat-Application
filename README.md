# 🗨️ Java Multithreaded Chat Application

This is a **Multithreaded Chat Application** built using Java Sockets and Threads. It enables multiple clients to connect to a central server and exchange messages in real time.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project contains two Java files:

- `ChatServer.java` – Handles incoming client connections and message broadcasting.
- `ChatClient.java` – Allows users to connect to the server and participate in the chat.

## 🚀 Features

- Multithreaded server capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously.
- Real-time chat functionality.
- Console-based interface for both server and clients.
- Simple and lightweight communication using TCP sockets.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The server (`ChatServer.java`) listens on a port for client connections.
- Each new client is handled in a separate thread.
- Messages from one client are broadcasted to all other connected clients.
- The client (`ChatClient.java`) connects to the server and sends/receives messages through the socket.

## 🛠️ How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Any terminal or IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.)
